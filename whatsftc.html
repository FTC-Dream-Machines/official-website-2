 <h2 class="RegText"><center>What is FTC?</h2></center>
<h4 class="RegText"><center>FTC is a tech challenge created by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). There are 3 rounds: the qualifying, state, and world competitions. Teams are created which contain students from grades seven to twelve. Groups build and program robots to battle against others. Once their robots are finished, they compete in a match which includes a series of tasks for which they are given approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds to complete. The time they are given includes a 30 second autonomous period and around 2 minutes of a driver controlled period. Thanks to FIRST and FTC, students not only improve and increase their knowledge in STEM subjects but also on life skills such as fundraising, teamwork, and time management. Below is an example video of the 2019 FTC Detroit World Championships.</h4></center><br><br>
